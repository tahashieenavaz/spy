# Spy!

Let me explain this game. Before anything else.
Spy is a game introduced to me by @tahashieenavaz.
The game players' are separated into two teams.
**Spies** and **regular players**.

Regular players should try to find spies with ambiguous question. And spies will constantly try to find the word regular players are making questions for.
